# 🍔 Fast Food Delivery

A full-stack web application that allows customers to order food online, restaurant owners to manage their stores and menus, and shippers to handle deliveries — all in real time.

## Note

At present, features associated with sending emails (such as forgotten password notifications and delivery confirmations) are unavailable because the server in use restricts the mail sending method offered by nodemailer.
